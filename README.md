## DIY Smart Watch

This is a github page containing the gerber file for the PCB of the smart watch.
The smart watch uses ESP8266 (ESP12F) as the microcontroller, and has a jack for a TFT display to connect. 
The esp12f can be coded using over the air programming, so no need to connect the smart watch, to program it again and again.
